# Machine_Learning_MIPT
**Assignments for the Konstantin Vorontsov's Math ML course at MIPT**

You can find lectures (in Russian) [here](https://bit.ly/ML-Vorontsov).
All the seminars are adapted from Andrii Hraboviy's [materials](https://github.com/andriygav/MachineLearningSeminars) and translated from Russian into English by me.
